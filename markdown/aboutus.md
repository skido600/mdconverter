# About Us 🌊

We’re **Wave Studio**, a small but passionate team of developers, designers, and dreamers who believe the web should stay **simple**, **open**, and **fast**.  
Our mission is to make development fun again — by building tools that are lightweight, flexible, and developer-friendly.

## Our Story

Wave Studio started with a single goal: _to empower creators_.  
We saw how heavy frameworks and complex setups were slowing down innovation, so we decided to build tools that put control back in the hands of the developer.

We focus on:

- 🧠 **Clarity** — simple, readable code.
- ⚡ **Speed** — instant setup and no build bloat.
- 🎨 **Creativity** — freedom to design and customize anything.

---

## What We Do

We design and maintain small tools, templates, and systems for developers:

- ✨ Static site generators using Markdown + Node.js
- 🛠️ Developer templates with React and Tailwind
- 📘 Open-source learning materials for beginners

Everything we build is **open source**, because we believe learning should be free and shared.

## Our Vision

> “Code is art — and everyone can create.”

Our vision is a world where any developer, from anywhere, can build something meaningful using open tools.  
We’re constantly improving our stack, exploring new ideas, and connecting with other creators.
