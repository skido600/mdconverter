# Markdown Publisher 📜

A lightweight and efficient static site generator built with Node.js. This tool transforms your Markdown files into a clean, syntax-highlighted static website, perfect for blogs, documentation, or personal notes.

## ✨ Features

-   **Markdown to HTML**: Automatically converts all `.md` files in the `markdown` directory into styled HTML pages.
-   **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks are beautifully highlighted using `highlight.js` with a dark theme.
-   **Simple Templating**: Uses a single `layout.html` file to maintain a consistent look and feel across all pages.
-   **Asset Handling**: Automatically copies images and stylesheets to the final build directory.
-   **Auto-Generated Index**: Creates an index page (`blogs.html`) that links to all generated articles.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v16 or higher)
-   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (or npm/yarn)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**
    ```bash
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
    *(or `npm install`)*

## Usage

Using the generator is straightforward. The core workflow involves creating Markdown files and running the build script.

1.  **Add Your Content**
    -   Create new blog posts or pages by adding `.md` files to the `/markdown` directory.
    -   Place any images you want to use inside the `/markdown/images` directory and reference them in your posts like this: `![Alt text](./images/your-image.png)`.

2.  **Build the Static Site**
    -   Run the following command in your terminal:
        ```bash
        pnpm run dev
        ```
    -   This script executes `build.js`, which compiles all markdown files, copies assets, and places the final static website into the `/dist` directory.

3.  **View Your Site**
    -   Open the `dist` folder and launch any `.html` file in your browser to see the result. The `blogs.html` file serves as the main index for all your posts.
